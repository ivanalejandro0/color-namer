Similar Colors
==============

This small app helps you pick names for your color variables.

There are several articles about color naming strategies, which of them work and which doesn't.
I recommend you reading [Sass color variables that don't suck](https://davidwalsh.name/sass-color-variables-dont-suck),
as a strategy for naming colors he recommends the tool [Name that Color](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/),
which I used but I felt like I needed a bit more.

Thanks to the [color-namer](https://github.com/zeke/color-namer) library (which does all the heavy lifting).
